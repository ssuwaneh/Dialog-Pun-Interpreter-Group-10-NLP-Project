# Dialog-Pun-Interpreter-Group-10-NLP-Project
Project to make a dialog based bot to interpert puns and jokes
# Overview
This project focuses on puns, a form of wordplay that relies on words with multiple meanings. Humor in puns emerges when an initial interpretation of a sentence is replaced by an unexpected but logically consistent alternative meaning. Because of this semantic incongruity, pun processing requires identifying multiple senses of words, evaluating their contextual fit, and understanding how sentence meaning shifts over time.

The goal of this project is to design a computational system capable of:

Identifying the multiple meanings involved in a pun

Explaining the semantic incongruity that produces humor

Answering user questions about a given pun
