# Context Validator Examples

## Example 1: Successful Pun
Sentence: "I used to be a banker but I lost interest."

Pun word: interest

Sense 1: financial earnings  
Sense 2: personal curiosity  

Explanation:
Both meanings are valid in context because the sentence refers both to banking (financial interest) and motivation (personal interest). The humor arises from the simultaneous applicability of both meanings.

## Example 2: Failed Meaning
Sentence: "The fisherman sat on the bank of the river."

Pun word: bank

Sense 1: financial institution  
Sense 2: river edge  

Explanation:
Only the "river edge" meaning is valid in the context. The "financial institution" meaning does not fit the sentence, so the validator should mark it as invalid.
